## Known Issues
If you have nay special chars(example: an emoji like Star ðŸŒŸ) in the PDF file, it gives a minor complain during execution. 
But it still does the job, so you can ingore that "char or object error" which you see in the output.

## Note:
In general you can use passifypdf to protect your PDF files against an opportunistic attacker. 
But you should not rely on this for mission-critical data.
